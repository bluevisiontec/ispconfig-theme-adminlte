## ISPConfig Theme AdminLTE

This project aims to provide an ISPConfig theme based on AdminLTE.

## Project status / further development

The development of this project just started with a very basic implementation of
AdminLTE.
Shortly after starting this project I found out that ISPconfig has a very basic
templating engine and that some template paths like dashlets are hardcoded.

For this reason I will not put much effort in this project, but I might add further
updates from time to time.

## Installation

So far there is no release, so for development or demo purposes clone the 
repository into /usr/local/ispconfig/interface/web/themes/adminlte
Afterwords you can select the Theme in Tools -> Interface -> Design
